    <p>
        Welcome to the WeddingFest07 Gallery! It may take some time to sort these properly, so bear with us as we weed out the 
        wierd, rude and just crappy pictures. Well, we might leave the rude ones in...
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a lot, so we have split it into three sections. These are firstly the <a href="gallery1.htm" title="Runup">runup</a>, including early visits,
        Bimble Inn setup, the legal bit and a pre wedding dinner. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, the <a href="gallery2.htm" title="WeddingFest!">WeddingFest</a> itself. This is the bit where we all got pissed and wet, and a bit drunk...
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, quite a big gallery of the <a href="gallery3.htm" title="Honeymoon">honeymoon</a> in Kintyre (that&apos;s Scotland...)
    </p>
